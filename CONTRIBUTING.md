# Contributing to OWASP ZAP
ZAP is a community project, and we are always delighted to welcome new contributors!

There are lots of ways you can contribute:

## Got a Question or Problem?
If you have a question or problem relating to using ZAP then the first thing to do is to check the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/FAQtoplevel).

We also include a comprehensive User Guide with ZAP which is also available online: https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki

If they don't help then please ask on the [User Group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-users)

## Found an Issue?
If you have found a bug then raise an issue on the zaproxy repo: https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues

Its worth checking to see if its already been reported, and including as much information as you can to help us diagnose your problem.

This FAQ explains some useful steps you can follow: https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/FAQhelp

## Found a Vulnerability?
If you have found a vulnerability in ZAP then please contact Simon Bennetts (psiinon at gmail.com) or Ricardo (thc202 at gmail.com) directly.

We are always very grateful to researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly and will be very happy to give credit for the valuable assistance they provide.

## Become a ZAP Evangelist
For information about the ZAP Evangelists and how to join up see the [ZAP Evangelists wiki page](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/ZapEvangelists)

## Help Improve the Documentation
The source for the ZAP [User Guide](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki) is underneath the zap-core-tree repo [src/help/zaphelp/contents](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/tree/master/src/help/zaphelp/contents) directory.

The Java Help included with ZAP and the online version are both generated from these HTML pages. Send Pull Requests to help us improve it.

## Improve existing scan rules or write new ones
The scan rules define how ZAP can automatically detect vulnerabilities.

We are always looking to improve existing ones and add new ones, so this is a great place to start helping with the ZAP code base.

More details can be found in the [Hacking ZAP blog posts](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Development#Hacking_ZAP)

## Improve existing add-ons or write new ones
Much of the ZAP functionality is implemented as add-ons, even features that are included 'as standard' in ZAP releases.

Add-ons are a great way to extend ZAP and can be ideal for student projects - many of the existing add-ons have been implemented by students, either through programs like Google Summer of Code and the Mozilla Winter of Security or directly as part of course work.

If you are interested in working on existing or new add-ons then the [Developer Group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) is the best place to ask questions.

## Improve the ZAP core
The ZAP 'core' underpins all of the other ZAP features, and so ensuring it is as robust as possible is very important.

Fixing [issues](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues) is very valuable and there are always many core improvements we want to make, again the [Developer Group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) is the best place to discuss these.
