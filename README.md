The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing as well as being a useful addition to an experienced pen testers toolbox.

We are in the process of migrating ZAP from Google Code.

Current status:
* zap-extensions migrated to https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions
* ZAP core help migrated to https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help
* Permissions removed from the Google Code repo
* ZAP wiki moved to https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki
* The source code and issues have also been migrated
* Still to do - lots of tidying up of links ;)
