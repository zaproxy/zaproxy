## Scan Policy

ZAP supports both active and passive scanning rules.

All rules are contained in add-ons so that they can be updated quickly and easily.

Active scanning is an attack on those targets.
You should NOT use it on web applications that you do not own.

It should be noted that active scanning can only find certain types of vulnerabilities.
Logical vulnerabilities, such as broken access control, will not be found by any active or automated vulnerability scanning.

Manual penetration testing should always be performed in addition to active scanning to find all types of vulnerabilities.

Please see the Terms of Use and Disclaimer for restrictions.
